## **Project Overview**
Our mental health affects how we think, feel and get along with other people. By going through these big feelings, and can sometimes feel a little too much for us to handle, it helps us understand how we can handle stress, be able to relate to others, and make choices in those moments. Mental health is important for everyone, from when we are babies, to when we grow up and become adults.

This website is created specifically to support children’s mental health, wellbeing, and mindfulness. It’s designed to help children understand and manage their big emotions in a safe, supportive environment. Parents can use it at home to guide their children, while schools can incorporate it into the classroom to encourage mindfulness. Although the main focus is on children, the website also serves as a helpful tool for parents, guardians, and educators to promote positive mental health and wellbeing for kids.

# UX Design
# **Theme colors:**
- These colors were chosen because they are intended for the user to feel at ease when accessing the website without feeling overwhelmed with bright flashy colors. There are animated floating bubbles to give it that little extra sensory moment for children that may suffer from autism and/ or other mental health concerns.

# **Fonts used:**
- Lato
- Oswald
These fonts were chosen as they are clear and simple to read and they have a soft touch to the website and do not have harsh edges around. Very good for the intended users. 



# Features

# Deployment
This was done through GitHub. 

# AI Implementation

# Testing and Validation

During the process of making Mindful Moments website, testing and validating the code was done throughout the timeframe of the deadline. In it, I had to make sure I completed regular debugging which was done by either the live preview on VS Code and mostly on the Chrome Browser which had great Dev Tools to support in this matter.
