# Testing and Validation

During the process of making Mindful Moments website, testing and validating the code was done throughout the timeframe of the deadline. In it, I had to make sure I completed regular debugging which was done by either the live preview on VS Code and mostly on the Chrome Browser which had great Dev Tools to support in this matter.
